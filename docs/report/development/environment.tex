\subsection{Environmental impact}

In the same way that this platform can bring a lot of goodness in the social
front, it certaintly comes with a cost. In my case the cost is an environmental
impact that cannot be understated.

In this project I will propose an ideal cluster that would be able to run the
software that I will design. The problem here is that maintaining a cluster
means the following:

\mylist
  \item Power supply.
  \item Maintaining a cooling system.
  \item The implied environmental costs of building the cluster.
\mylistend

All of these can be reduced by using the minimum amount of cluster time as
possible. This means to run the software in ``batches'' or with a very low
latency. However, this is not possible at all if the cluster has a lot of
requests, and that is to be expected.

Therefore, in the development of the cluster I will focus most of my efforts
into keeping the cluster as environmental friendly as possible.
