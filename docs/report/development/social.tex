 
\subsection{TODO: Social impact}

This section is really important for this project. It is about the impact that
this platform will make to society. This is not a direct impact, but an
indirect one. The social impact of this platform comes in two ways:

\mylist
  \item The fact that a number of businesses will take advantage that this
platform exists.
  \item Indirectly, all the impact that all the services built on top of this
platform will produce.
\mylistend

This means that, ideally, the social impact of this platform can be huge.
