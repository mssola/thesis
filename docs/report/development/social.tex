Another thing that we might want to consider is how can this project impact
upon society. In this regard we have to deal with the following topics:

\mylist
  \item How can this project impact the economy.
  \item How can this project change how people interact with the city.
\mylistend

These two topics can be answered with: it depends. It depends on how other
developers take advantage of this platform. It depends on how this project is
implemented in public institutions, if it is implemented at all. It depends on
how this project is further developed. Ideally speaking, it can have a big
impact because:

\begin{enumerate}
  \itemsep0em
  \item If more developers join this platform or extend it, it can lead with
the development of apps that can be used by regular users. This can improve
both the perception and the experience of a user towards the city.
  \item If the first point happens, it is very likely that people can earn
money from the apps being developed.
  \item The government can use the given information to improve some services
or make them more efficient.
\end{enumerate}

So ideally speaking there are a lot of opportunities around this platform.
These opportunities would most likely have a very positive impact upon the city
and the people in it.
