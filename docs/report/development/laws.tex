 
\subsection{BETA: Laws and Regulation}

The platform that has been built during my Bachelor Degree Thesis does not
violate any European or International law. From the very beginning it has been
stated that this platform fetches all the data from the {\it iCity} platform.
This platform is an European effort that has been created according to the laws
of the European Union. Therefore, the platform that I have built in my Thesis
is also bound by the laws of the European Union.

For this same reason, I conclude that this platform is not infringing in any
way the laws and the regulations from the European Union. Moreover, all the
infraestructures integrated in the {\it iCity} platform, have their own
policies and rules. This does not affect this project because all the
infraestructures that I have chosen are free to use and with no limitations
whatsoever.
