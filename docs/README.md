# GEP

GEP stands for "Gestió de Projecte". That is, is a course that lasts for
a month and its main goal is to prepare the student for the thesis. The
workflow of this course was to make some deliveries during the month. The
course ends with a final report and a presentation.

# Midterm

After spending a couple of months working on this project, it was expected of
me to write a midterm report. It's not too fancy or detailed, but it did the
job.

# Report

The report directory contains all the LaTeX files that are needed to generate
the final report of my Bachelor Degree Thesis.

# Lecture

The slides for the lecture.
