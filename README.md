# My Thesis

This repository holds all the files that have something to do with my
Bachelor's thesis. The code is structured in the following way:

* gep: the LaTeX files used for the GEP course.
* report: the LaTeX files containing the final report of my thesis.
* examples: a set of examples of Storm, Summingbird, etc.
* snacker: this is the real deal. It has the source code of my Bachelor's Degree
Thesis.

# Licensing

My Bachelor Degree Thesis is being developed as an open source project. Each
subdirectory represents a subproject in itself. This means that each
subdirectory defines its license and the copyright holders.
