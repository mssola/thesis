\chapter{Preface}

We are living exciting times. Technology and science are moving forward in a
very fast pace and societies around the globe are benefiting greatly from this
situation. These technologies have improved the way we, as a society, perceive
the world around us.

At the same time, it is clear that the flow of information has increased over
the past few years. This leaves us a very important opportunity: we can use this
information to obtain new ways to improve our societies.

This project is quite humble and it does not try to change societies. Rather,
it is focuses on cities. This project consists on building a platform that
operates on all the information generated by cities in order to obtain useful
data. This data can then be used to improve the quality of life of the
citizens of the selected cities.

Back in January of 2014 I had no idea about the topic of my Bachelor Degree
Thesis. I didn't know where to go, how the whole process worked, etc. Luckily,
my director Jordi presented to me this topic and I was thrilled. I saw lots of
opportunities and room for investigation.

My personal goal for this project is to explore the technologies surrounding
{\it stream processing}, and how these technologies can then be applied to the
concept of {\it Smart cities}. I am satisfied with the results and I think that
this project has fulfilled my personal goals.

Therefore, I want to thank my director Jordi Garcia Almi√±ana for presenting
me this topic and for giving me the opportunity to work on it. It has been a
great experience and I hope the reader can feel this satisfaction of mine when
reading this memoir. Here it is. I hope you enjoy it.
